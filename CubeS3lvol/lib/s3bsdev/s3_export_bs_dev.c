 *   s3_export_bs_dev -- the read-only bs_dev behind an imported export 
 *
 *   This is what makes an lvol on node B a clone of a snapshot on node A. It is
 *   handed to blobstore as an esnap parent: blobstore reads through it for any
 *   cluster the clone has not written yet, and copies out of it on the first
 *   write to such a cluster.
 *
 *   === What it is not ===
 *
 *   No WAL, no overlay, no flusher, no chunk map, no journal, no local device.
 *   The data it serves is already durable and immutable in S3, so all of that
 *   machinery has nothing to do. Reads are ranged GETs against object keys
 *   derived from the manifest, and everything on the write side reports -EROFS.
 *
 *   === Threading ===
 *
 *   Unlike s3_bs_dev, nothing here is bounced to an owner thread. There is no
 *   mutable shared state to protect: the manifest is immutable once parsed, and
 *   an I/O's aggregation state is touched only by the thread that submitted it
 *   (S3 completions are delivered back to the submitting thread, see
 *   s3_client.h). That matters because blobstore creates a channel per thread
 *   that touches the clone -- with nvmf that is one per poll group.
 *
 *   === Lifetime ===
 *
 *   destroy() is called by blobstore when it decides the back device is no
 *   longer referenced -- including blob_set_back_bs_dev() after a decouple,
 *   which freezes *new* blob I/O and then destroys this device. Freeze does not
 *   wait for ranged GETs already submitted to S3: their completions bounce back
 *   via send_msg and still touch this struct. inflight counts those I/Os so
 *   unregister (and free) wait for the last one, instead of racing it.
 *
 *   That is also why both the manifest and the S3 client are held by reference
 *   here: the import RPC that created this is long gone, and a release_export
 *   may have happened in between.

 * out is to fetch the manifest again and carry on against the new one, which is
 * what `generation` is for.
 *
 * The hard part is not fetching it. It is that the whole of this file is lock
 * free *because* the manifest never changes: blobstore makes a channel per
 * thread that touches the clone, and every one of them reads dev->m with no
 * serialisation at all. Swapping it is therefore the one operation that has to
 * think about the other threads.
 *
 * What makes it tractable is that no reader holds the manifest across an await.
 * Every dereference is synchronous inside export_read() or export_is_zeroes():
 * a chunk's key is copied into the sub-I/O before the GET is submitted, and the
 * completion never looks at the manifest again. So a reader's window is one
 * synchronous stretch on its own thread.
 *
 * Hence a grace period rather than a lock. The pointer is replaced first -- a
 * pointer store, so every reader sees one manifest or the other, never a torn
 * value, and both are valid to read against. The old one is then released only
 * after spdk_for_each_channel() has run on every thread that has a channel:
 * having got a turn on each of them means every reader that could have loaded
 * the old pointer has already finished with it, because it could only have been
